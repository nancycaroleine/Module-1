# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Adding Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To write a Python program for adding two complex numbers, and get the user input using the `eval()` function.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Use the `eval()` function to get two complex numbers as input from the user.
3. Print the complex numbers entered by the user.
4. Perform the addition of the two complex numbers using the `+` operator.
5. Print the sum of the two complex numbers.
6. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223060181
#Name-NANCY CAROLEINE P R
#Write your code here
num1 = eval(input("Enter the first complex number: "))
num2 = eval(input("Enter the second complex number: "))
print("First complex number:", num1)
print("Second complex number:", num2)
sum = num1 + num2
print("Sum of the two complex numbers:", sum)
```
